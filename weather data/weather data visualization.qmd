Standardize how we pull weather data for st paul, rosemount, becker, waseca and rosholt

start with rosemount, then expand to st paul

understand how Jason's rmarkdown file works, figure out the minimum info required in the weather file

we want one file of all sites and all weather data that we can update every year

workflow: download master file, filter to the sites and years you want, generate figures
