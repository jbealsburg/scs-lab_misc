# Objective

We wanted to spray wheatgrass with herbicides commonly used on the st paul campus. Some products we expected injury (acetochlor), other products we expected no injury (s-metolachlor) but wanted to do side by side comparisons with unsprayed wheatgrass plots to get some data. 

Our hope was to find a corn/soy/small grain herbicide that could be used in wheatgrass without obvious injury and provide additional weed control options in unexpected research situations. 

We wanted to use products not previously tested in northern MN 

We wanted to practice doing an herbicide screening study

# Wheatgrass weed control

## establishing wheatgrass

Weed control in wheatgrass is most important during establishment. When we apply herbicides, we apply them to all plots so if any injury is occurring, it is happening across all plots. 

For a couple years, s-metolachlor has been applied in early spring (April) for weed control with no expected or observed injury. 

We have applied 2,4-D in the fall after wheatgrass is ~4" tall and not observed obvious injury. 

## wheatgrass sensitivity to residual herbicides

wheatgrass is a small grass seed. 

There is concern that 2,4-D and s-metolachlor can impact an emerging wheatgrass seed.

We only use glyphosate as a burndown prior to planting wheatgrass so there is not plant-back interval if we need to replant. 

When terminating a wheatgrass stand, glyphosate alone is effective, but it's very important the plant is actively growing. One time we harvested kernza in August and then the plant went dormant after harvest for a month due to the drought. We could not kill the stand until it actively started regrowing. 

## Labels

As of 28Feb2023, 2,4-D is the only labelled herbicide in kernza and must be applied after tillering (4-8 inches tall) and before boot stage. This typically gives a 2 week window of 14May - 1June to control some broadleaf weeds in the spring. 

Some herbicides labelled for "Grasses grown for seed" have been applied to kernza without obvious injury. Herbicides for perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, turf and other perennial grasses grown for seed are unlikely to cause injury. We tend to use products from the Winfield company; sometimes these generic products are not labelled for grasses grown for seed, but the original trade name product is labelled. For example, Dual Magnum herbicide is labelled for grasses grown for seed, but charger max herbicide is not labelled for grasses grown for seed even though both products contain the same active ingredient (s-metolachlor). This is true of Prowl as well.

## what we already know

The 2017 herbicide screen at Estling Farms and Magnusson Farms found the following...

Full rate applications of Dual Boundary and Prowl resulted in slight delay of maturity for wheatgrass. 

Full rate applications of Wolverine, Facet L and Axial XL had no effect on the crop.

We expected Dual, Prowl, Facet L, dicamba and Bison to show no injury when applied because they were labelled for grass grown for seed. 

We also tested herbicides that we thought could cause injury. 

Acetochlor is a PRE and POST product for corn. We thought acetochlor may cause injury because it is labelled for POST control of volunteer wheat and barnyadgrass. 

Boundary is a PRE product for soybean. We thought Boundary would likely not cause damage because it is composed of two products that are seperately labelled for grasses grown for seed, s-metolachlor and metribuzin. It also showed no injury in 2017 trial. 

Axial XL is a POST product for wheat and barley. We thought Axial XL may cause injury since it is labelled for POSt control of grass weeds, however it showed no crop injury in 2017. 

Wolverine is a POST product for wheat wheat and barley. We thought Wolverine may cause injury since it is labelled for POST control of grasses like wild oat, but were told this product has been used without injury on wheatgrass for multiple years. No injury noted in 2017 trial. 

We got busy with other experiments and the timing of our POST treatments was very late. Many of our POST labels recommend apply after tilering, which would be right at stem elongation (Zadocks 30). We were hoping to apply our POST treatments late as this would increase the liklihood of injury and more closely resemble a research scenario where a timing is late, but we wanted to apply around boot stage (Zadocks 40). These applications would still be on label, but more risky. However, we were so busy that we applied even late than we wanted too (such is research) and were already at seedhead emergence (Zadocks 52). At this point, we no longer expected to not observe wheatgrass injury even in the products labelled for grasses grown for seed. We expected to observe injury in all our POST treatments, especially in the group 4's (Bison, dicamba, Facet L)

# Introduction

IWG was planted in fall of 2021. 
In spring of 2022, PRE herbicides were applied and then IWG injury was scored ~10 days after application. 
In summer of 2022, POST herbicide treatments were applied and IWG injury was scored again ~10 days after application. 

IWG injury was scored on a scale of 0-10, where 10 was severe damage. Scoring was done blind by Jesse in spring, and by Jesse Cole and Lara in summer. 

The weed abundance was also visually scored. The site for this preliminary study was chosen because high weed pressure was expected, however there was very low weed pressure throughout the entire field during the study. 
The weed scores were meant to indicate relative differences in weeds among plots and if any sort of weed injury was visible.
Due to low weed pressure, the weed-free plot treatment was not maintained and was managed identically to the weedy plots. There still were very few weeds ( <1 plant per square meter)
Due to the low weed pressure, the primary utility of the tofu data set is the IWG injury data. 


Herbicides were applied at maximum rates and the summer applications were about 1-2 weeks later than ideal and IWG plants were already quite large and some seedheads were starting to emerge. 
The POST treatments were a worst case scenario and if no injury was observed in this study, it's very unlikely any injury will be observed.

# Findings

IWG was  resilient to maximum rates of unlabelled herbicides applied at times when the risk of crop injury was high. All plants produced grain and there were no obvious differences in grain yield in the field, though differences in grain yield were detected after threshing.  

With the exception of acetochlor, the PRE herbicides did not cause any observable damage to the IWG plant and yields did not differ among control and plots that received different PREs. Months after application, IWG plants that received an aceotochlor application were stunted. 

ALL POST herbicides caused observable damage to the IWG plant. Of these herbicides, Axial XL caused the least visible damage and yields did not differ between axial and plots that recieved no herbicides. Axial XL (Pinoxaden) is a grass herbicide, which is exciting as we currently do not have any grass herbicides available. 

Wolverine is an herbicide commonly used by the wheat breeding lab on wheatgrass. Here we observed visible crop injury though this may be due to the high rate and the late timing, but no yield impact. The higher rates of injury observed in plots where dicamba and bison and facet were applied may be simply due to timing, as these growth regulators were applied to IWG after seedheads had begun to emerge. IWG sprayed with dicamba yielded the lowest (336 kg ha vs. `r (775+704+680+657+607+512)/6` kg ha average of other plots)

The low injury observed in the PREs (prowl, dual and boundary) and the low injury in Axial XL even at a high rate and late timing is useful information if grass weeds pose a problem in future experiments. Pinoxaden controls foxtails and oat, but not brome.

The lack of yield penalty observed in wolverine and facet and all PREs is exciting. 

# Recommendations

Currently, the only option for the control of grass weeds is through PREs. Further trials looking at other grass herbicides and that look at different timings of the herbicides in this study would provide more information. 

IWG is a very competitive plant that often doesn't warrant an herbicide application. The most injurious weeds to yield are likely winter annuals, which can be controlled with 2,4-D applied in the fall or early spring. Weed control, especially in patchy or underfertilized IWG stands can be helpful for ease of harvest, as large lambsquarter weeds can clog combine headers and add unwanted moisture to the grain tank. Again, 2,4-D is a good tool for the control of these summer annual escape weeds. 

The primary reason to do further research into IWG tolerance to grass herbicides is for the  scenario we observed in the NALI experiment where downy brome choked out the IWG and alfalfa. In this scenario, we did not know there was a history of Downy Brome at this site and our primary control method would have been a PRE we would've had to have applied after IWG emergence. If we had a POST grass herbicide for Downy Brome that was safe on IWG, it would've been able to save the study. Future research should look at other grass herbicides that could control downy brome and measure the effects of PRE and grass POST herbicides on *establishing* wheatgrass stands.
