```{r load data}
library(tidyverse)

read.csv("yield gap MASTER - data_9Jan2025.csv") -> dat

# Filter out Jakes special sample
dat %>%
  filter(sample != "special") %>%
  mutate(sample = as.numeric(sample)) %>%
  rename(spacing = row.spacing) %>%
  mutate(site = fct_recode(site,tentis = "whitebarn"))-> dat1

```

### Conversions

Each sample is 2 meters of row at a given row spacing to represent an area

At 7 inch row spacing, 1 sample represents 0.35 square meters.

At 7.5 inch row spacing, 1 sample represents 0.38 square meters.

For most trials, \~0.5 square meters is typically used for estimating grain yield. So these samples are about 25% smaller than typical quadrats used for yield prediction. We opted for smaller quadrats in this trial over concern the paper bags would be too full to fully close with a 0.5m2 sample which could cause parts of the sample to be lost when walking through the field and in transit to campus.

```{r, include=F}
library(measurements)

# 7 inch row spacing x 2 meters of row
conv_unit(7,"in","m") * 2

# 7.5 inch row spacing x 2 meter of row
conv_unit(7.5,"in","m") * 2

# 30" x 30" quadrat
conv_unit(30*30, "inch2", "m2")


dat1 %>%
  mutate(yield_gm2 = dry_nobag_threshed_grams/(conv_unit(spacing,"in","m") * 2),
         yield_kgha = conv_multiunit(yield_gm2,
                                     from = "g / m2",
                                     to = "kg / hectare"), 
         yield_lbsA = conv_multiunit(yield_kgha,
                                    from = "kg / hectare",
                                    to = "lbs / acre")) -> dat2

            mean = mean(yield_lbsA),
            sd = sd(yield_lbsA),
            cv = sd/mean*100,
            max = max(yield_lbsA),
            min = min(yield_lbsA)) %>%

  knitr::kable(caption = "Predicted kernza grain yields in lbs per acre.  Seperated by site. Bin run quality. Estimated from 2 meters of row length at a minimum of 6 points in the field.")
```

### Notes

-   These predicted kernza yields are somewhat high. I was expecting around 400-100 lbs A, especially for stands in their second and third year of production with shattering. Even minimum values are mostly above 300 lbs A. Why are we predicting such high grain yields?

    -   Sample collection error (sampling a larger area than stated in protocol or sampling only high yielding areas) is unlikely across so many different sites and collectors.

    -   Sample processing error is more possible. We followed the standard threshing protocol, but it is imperfect. Our final samples still contain some empty hulls and stems. We could dry samples further and attempt to thresh again to break down spikelets and stems into smaller pieces for further sieving and aspirating. This would reduce our predicted grain yield, but samples are already about as clean as most combines would achieve. These predicted grain yields are for uncleaned seed at "bin run" quality. The amount of clean naked seed is less.

-   As I (Jesse) collected samples from both Stan and Tentis, I am very surprised we predicted higher yields for Tentis. I am not surprised the variation for Stan is much lower.

### Sample processing note

All samples were processed using our [standard protocol of threshing, sieving and aspirating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oHFbAqYCipop3GpHFU4xqgxcJX-R6GEAkzti5fYfBlg/edit?tab=t.0). The quality of these samples were about as pure as samples that come directly out of the wintersteiger plot combine we use. They contain stems, empty hulls, spikelets and seeds that are both naked and within a hull. As a result, their weight represents the amount we expect to leave a field, "bin run". These samples would require further cleaning and the amount of pure seed in the sample is likely \~20-30% less of the "bin run" yields predicted.

| Processing step | sample weight (g) | predicted yield (lbs A) | change from reported value (%) |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| standard threshing, sieving, aspirating | 33.8 | 791 | 0 |
| 1 day storage in lab, humidity gain | 34.1 | 799 | 1 |
| light sieving to remove obvious stems, spikelets | 32 | 749 | -5 |
| standard sieving, removing empty stems | 29.3 | 686 | -13 |
| aggressive sieving, removing most hulls including hulls with seed | 25.5 | 597 | -24.6 |
| smaller sieve, primarily naked seed remains | 23.5 | 550 | -30.5 |
