   abstract = {Mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek, Fabaceae] is one of the most important food legume crops in Asia. It is also gaining importance in other parts of the world such as Australia and Canada. The United States imported mungbean worth ' '22 million dollars during 2014. To establish domestic production and to determine if mungbean can be produced in rotation with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), replicated experiments were conducted during 2012 and 2013 using two cultivars (Berken and TexSprout), two planting dates (early and late July), and two row spacings (37.5 and 75 cm). Cultivar and planting date effects on seed yield were not significant, however, narrow row spacing resulted in significant higher seed yield and concentration of protein over the wider row spacing (1.76 vs. 0.86 Mg · ha L1 yield and 24.9% vs. 23.7% protein). Early planting resulted in lower sugar and oil concentrations over late planting (4.4% vs. 5.5% sugar and 1.24% vs. 1.99% oil). Average mungbean values for seed yield, seed size, and concentrations of protein, sugars, and oil were 1.31 Mg · ha L1 , 7.08 g/seed 100 , 24.3%, 4.91%, and 1.59%, respectively. Low harvest index values (17% to 25%) indicated that potential exists for improvement in mungbean seed yield. The results indicated that mungbean can be easily produced in rotation with winter wheat in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.},
