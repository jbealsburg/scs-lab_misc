   abstract = {Introduction: In wheat, kernel weight (KW) is a key determinant of grain yield (GY). However, it is often overlooked when improving wheat productivity under climate warming. Moreover, little is known about the complex effects of genetic and climatic factors on KW. Here, we explored the responses of wheat KW to diverse allelic combinations under projected climate warming conditions. Methods: To focus on KW, we selected a subset of 81 out of 209 wheat varieties with similar GY, biomass, and kernel number (KN) and focused on their thousand-kernel weight (TKW). We genotyped them at eight kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction markers closely associated with TKW. Subsequently, we calibrated and evaluated the process-based model known as Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM-Wheat) based on a unique dataset including phenotyping, genotyping, climate, soil physicochemistry, and on-farm management information. We then used the calibrated APSIM-Wheat model to estimate TKW under eight allelic combinations (81 wheat varieties), seven sowing dates, and the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) designated SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, driven by climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, EC-Earth3-Veg, MIROC-ES2L, and UKESM1-0-LL. Results: The APSIM-Wheat model reliably simulated wheat TKW with a root mean square error (RMSE) of < 3.076 g TK-1 and R2 of > 0.575 (P < 0.001). The analysis of variance based on the simulation output showed that allelic combination, climate scenario, and sowing date extremely significantly affected TKW (P < 0.001). The impact of the interaction allelic combination × climate scenario on TKW was also significant (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the variety parameters and their relative importance in the APSIM-Wheat model accorded with the expression of the allelic combinations. Under the projected climate scenarios, the favorable allelic combinations (TaCKX-D1b + Hap-7A-1 + Hap-T + Hap-6A-G + Hap-6B-1 + H1g + A1b for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) mitigated the negative effects of climate change on TKW. Discussion: The present study demonstrated that optimizing favorable allelic combinations can help achieve high wheat TKW. The findings of this study clarify the responses of wheat KW to diverse allelic combinations under projected climate change conditions. Additionally, the present study provides theoretical and practical reference for marker-assisted selection of high TKW in wheat breeding.},

   abstract = {Annual plants are currently the dominant growth habit for grain production systems but often create agroecosystems with negative environmental consequences. Developing grains with a perennial growth habit provides an opportunity to produce staple crops in a more environmentally beneficial manner. Amphiploids of perennial tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum elongatum) and common annual wheat (Triticum aestivum) have been produced for wheat-like traits while exhibiting post-sexual cycle regrowth (PSCR). Here we report results from two experiments at two locations in the Palouse region of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) designed to (1) evaluate a subset of the current perennial grain germplasm base and (2) test post-harvest management strategies on key perennial growth habit traits. The first experiment evaluated 18 putative perennial amphiploid lines, two annual wheat varieties, and one intermediate wheatgrass variety (Thinopyrum intermedium) for yield, PSCR, key agronomic traits, and grain quality characteristics. Results from this trial showed mean yields ranged from 713 to 2874 kg/ha among the amphiploids and 1,627 to 6,867 kg/ha with the annual wheat varieties. Variation across the amphiploids was found for key agronomic and quality traits, indicating potential for continued selection and improvement. When compared to the two annuals, the four highest-yielding amphiploids produced the same yield at one location but 50–60% less at the other. Amphiploids were generally taller with increased tiller number, flowered later, had lower leaf chlorophyll content, and decreased threshability, compared to annual varieties. Regarding grain qualities, amphiploids had lower test weights and thousand kernel weights, smaller kernel diameters, lower starch content, and higher protein, ash, and fiber. The second experiment investigated the effect of post-harvest residue management on PSCR and winter survival of two amphiploids using mowing, burning, and a control. Mowing the residue and PSCR significantly increased winter survival across both amphiploids at one location from 3% in the control to 63% in the mowed treatment. Burning the residue did not improve survival. Our results address three important challenges in perennial grain development in the Palouse region: selecting a stable perennial habit, increasing grain yield, and improving marketable grain quality traits. Each of these challenges will require significant research efforts by plant breeders and agronomists prior to widespread adoption of perennial grains in the Palouse region of the PNW.},
